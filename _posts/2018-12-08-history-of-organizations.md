As I mentioned in my [Leadership vs Management article](http://localhost:4000/management/skills/2018/10/20/leadership-vs-management.html), I am exploring leadership and management styles. I want to know what makes for inspiring, effective leadership. On the other hand, I want to know why some managers are so hard to work with, even though they might be the best buddies to grab a drink with!

This is part 2 of the essay and focuses on why we need organizations after all. In this article we'll take a look at:

- What made our species survive
- What made us develop groups, tribes, and organizations
- How organizations evolved
- Where we are now in terms of organization evolution

Warning: This article is not for those who believe in Young Earth creationism; dinosaur bones are real!

  <title>History of Organization</title>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Before we jump into why we need organization and leadership let’s take a quick walk into where we came from and why our genus Homo Sapiens succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sapiens thought to have merged around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Roughly around 200,000 years ago homo sapiens became recognizable. They evolved in Africa around 90,000 years ago and successfully migrated to populate the rest of the world, including to Europe where Neanderthals had already been settled. However, it wasn't until about 50,000 years ago when homo sapiens developed capacity for language.

    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        There are several hypothesis as why sapiens succeeded but not neanderthals even though neanderthals were physically stronger and faster in short distance run. Some of those hypothesis include: violence from modern human, diseases, competitive exclusion, inbreeding, climate change or a combination of these and more...
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the one hypothesis that relates to this article is <b>the brain power</b>. Neanderthals had brawn but humans advantage on brains. Sapiens brain were built to support more complex functions such as creativity, communication and imagination. In short, one explanation is that imaginations, ability to believe myth and fictions, and ability to mass communicate (storytelling) became our ancestors biggest advantage.

      One great example of human’s creative mind is religion. We are capable of believing in supernatural. Our creative mind
      allows us to believe in extraordinary things like God with unlimited power and so kind who is also tolerant of all the
      suffering in the world and would punish you hardly in after life. We have communicated those belief and created a community around it. Hence, one of human’s biggest invention is region! Religion made us form tribes, worship Gods and work together to make Gods happy and satisfied. Religion made us believe in afterlife, Heaven and Hell. We do good things to enter the heavens and pray to be protected from the hell.

  <title>socialization</title>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Human are also social animals. But what is socialization and is there a limit to how much interactions we can handle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking too much into biology, once again, evolution supports socialization (sorry introverts, including myself!). Look at it this way, if a father and a mother stayed around longer, children had a better chance of surviving. Larger families and tribes could also better defend themselves against intruders. They would help each other with their youngsters and share food and nests. That's how we formed teams and tribes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        What about those who want to stay alone? If one has to only answer to themselves and can do whatever they want, can we call it a team or an organization?
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when we add a second person to the team? Now we have links <b>n*(n-1)/2</b>. The moment we add a second person, we have a team dynamics, it’s a small team but it is at last a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that come a few hundred thousands forward, the questions is what team size is right?

      In the following context, let's define relationship as knowing well who each person is and how are they related to others. Even though human are social, there’s limit to our social skills which we can have a meaningful, stable and cohesive relationship with others. The real number falls somewhere between 100 to 250, commonly <b>150</b>. The formula above was first proposed in 1990 by an anthropologist name Robin Dunbar as the Primate brain size and average of social group size.

      <p>
        Dunbar suggests that a number larger than this requires restrictions, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a <b>stable</b> and <b>cohesive</b> group. In other words, our brain struggles to make meaningful and stable relationships when the number is greater than Dunbar’s number. That’s why we cannot trust strangers and that’s why we form tribes, organizations, and governments. Now, we are entering the Complex Adaptive System subject (topic for another blog post, maybe). Which is a system in which a perfect understanding of the individual parts does not automatically convey a perfect understanding of the whole system's behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we know we <i>are</i> social animals and there's a limit in how many meaningful relationships our brain can handle, let's look at how organizations formed and where are we at now!

  <title>Organization Structure</title>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Before we start talking about leadership styles and their effectiveness let's take a look at different organizations throughout history. Considering evolution, we see that we have evolved from small groups of family to survive, to build today’s mega city and civilization. We went from staying together in group of dozens to have our species survive and pass our genes, to understanding biology and manipulating our genes! But, we couldn't have came so far if we had stayed in our small family circle or tribes. Forming bigger groups and organizations allowed us to shift our attention from just survival to understanding the world around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book “Reinventing Organizations” charts the evolution of organizations as the following:

        Organizations don't exist at this stage, yet. However, tribes of few hundred started forming. Elders had special status because of their experience and knowledge: In a time with no form of writing, elders served as walking libraries. Humanity shifted to a stage of consciousness, however, cause and effect were poorly understood. A rise in believe in magic happened to explain the unknown. Some describe this era as when our sensorimotor skills started developing. The behavior of humans in magic magenta time is described as for a 24-month old toddler: biting finger feels different than vs biting a toy.

      Some time around 10,000 years ago leaders started ruling by force and fear. The group size was well above Dunbar’s number. The tribes believed that they have to use control to defend themselves. Ego started to form, individuals had a sense of self that separated them from others. Tribes were subsisting on horticulture which was the start of civilizations.

      We still see examples of impulsive red in today's era in the form of wars, gangs, and the Mafia.

      <p>
        Within the past couple of centuries, humankind have evolved far beyond absolute right or wrong. We started to understand and handle greater complexity. This was the start of industrial revolution. We understood machines and as a result, started making our organizations like machines. If you look closely at most leaders in business and politics worldwide, you see they are operating in achievement orange organizations. Other examples of this group are corporations such as Walmart and Coca-Cola.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achievement orange organizations' effectiveness is through
        <b>innovation</b>, <b>accountability</b>, and <b>meritocracy</b>.
        <br />
        This is the time that organizations started having research and development, marketing, and product management departments.
        The traditional <b>Command and Control</b> is now shifted to <b>Predict and Control</b>. Managers set achievement target for their employees and those who reach their target are getting rewarded by being promoted
        or getting a salary raise or bonus.

      Pluralistic Green
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Pluralistic green organizations are still relatively new, they started forming in the current century while orange is still dominant in politics and businesses. The break though here is <b>empowerment</b>! The organizations still operate in pyramid hierarchy but managers push through majority voting and are expected to share power. Examples of green organizations are academic thinking, nonprofits, social workers, and community activists. Some organizations who are also early adopters of pluralistic green are Southwest Airlines and Ben and Jerry's.
        <br />
        Another noticeable change in pluralistic green organizations is that management style has shifted from being a boss to modest behavior. This modesty is a result of understanding and respecting other people's feelings. Not only manager are expected to be respectful and open minded, green organizations also invest in soft-skill trainings for their employees.
        <br />
        Green organizations practice 360-degree reviews, meaning not only managers review their employees, employees also get to review their managers and provide feedback and improvements.
        <br />
        Culture is very important, for example Southwest Airlines believes in Freedom; while Ben and Jerry's pride themselves for caring about Environment.
        <br />
        The downside of green organizations is that even though they pride themselves as being open minded and tolerant. They are also intolerant of those who don't fit their "culture!"

      <p>
        There is an evolution in consciousness, that there is a momentum in evolution towards ever more complex and refined ways of dealing with the world. In this stage, we are now well aware of complexity. Instead of either-or there is both-and. We must combine and process information in a new way that dis-identify

        So far, we looked into the history of groups and organizations. We understood why we're social and why forming teams was essential to our survival. Also, as Dunbar suggests as our teams and organizations got bigger the need for leaders grow. Not only just a leader, but also the leadership style. In a modern society, a company who wants to run their organization like an impulsive red is not going to survive. Meanwhile, military cannot operate in pluralistic green or evolutionary teal, especially during war!
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for us to determine what type of organization we have or want, and how our leaders should operate, <a href="http://localhost:4000/management/skills/2018/10/20/leadership-vs-management.html">we need to take a look at some leadership styles</a>. We have to decide what organization we want before we have a shanty town. Who sets the goal and the vision and what are we here to achieve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Across all these styles, a strong leader not only is setting a long term vision on how life is going to be in 5, 10, 20 years from now, they make sure that the employees are well-aware of the goals and empowers them to get there. Setting goals is an expectation for leaders but it's equally important to understand how do a leader handle disagreement and intolerance. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Is the plan to prison the person who made a mistake or cast them out? </li>
        <li> If everyone is agreeable then leadership is easy. </li>
        <li> What if there’s diversity? </li>
        <li> What’s someone’s perspective of someone else’s viewpoint? </li>

  <strong>TODOs</strong>

  Many of us have parents and grandparents who only worked for one company honorably, most of them changed jobs only if they had to. But this is changing rapidly for the new generation that's entering the workforce. I, for example, worked for 5 companies for the past 15 years that I started my profession. I co-founded Tested Minds with my husband in 2010 because I wanted to have time and space to think and be creative. I wanted to work on projects that interest me and allow me to flourish. I wanted have the freedom to pick the technology I work with, my client and most of all something that "worth" my time and life. After a few years of consulting, due to mutual agreement my husband and I decided to switch places. He spend most of his time growing our consulting while I worked for more established companies to ensure our financial are secured. One of those projects that truly made our hearts happy is an epilepsy project with to improve the life of people, specially young children to suffer epilepsy. We were introduced to a professor and John Hopkins university and surgeons from Cleavland clinic. Our team is working hard to achieve a higher goal in life. Our goal is to play a part in an amazing project that would save lives. Aside from my own company, barely over 3 years at State Farm Insurance Company is my record.

  I truly believed in the mission, as I understood when I joined them, of all companies I joined. In some cases, those missions changed, in other cases my fast moving life made me leave. Nonetheless, I have never joined a company that I didn't trust their leadership or their goal. 

  I always find myself looking for strong inspirational people I want to follow and learn from and group of youngsters that I can mentor. Throughout the past 15 years, I have seen several team formations, some better than the others. Often, I wish I had the authority, not just the responsibility, to change the team structure. My ideal team includes:
  <ul> 
    <li>A strong inspirational leader to knows how has a great vision and ability to form a group who moves towards that vision</li>
    <li>A manager who I can refer to for typical company policy stuff, request PTO, attend conference, talk about my goals and improvements</li>
    <li>Strong technical people who are ginounly happy to share knowledge and help building a stronger technical team. Those who want others around them to be as good or even better and are not holding knowledge so that they are the most senior (in a land of blinds a man with one eye is a leader)</li>
    <li>A group of young and open-minded juniors who are ready to take the world and do not build a box around themselves</li>
  </ul>

  Recently, I attended an amazing conference in Anguilla which include couple dozen of leaders from around the glob and everybody shares knowledge. Cameron... was one of the presenters who talked about how he re-orged his company .... He nailed what I am hoping to see in more companies and very well articulated his talks in his [article](http://blah.com)
