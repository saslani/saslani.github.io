        Organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership. Leadership is the ability to set visions and
        influence followers, providing support and guidance, to achieve a goal. In business world, leadership also involves
        connecting the value consumers to the value producers. A true leader, has followers who are inspired by that leader and
        therefore want to follow him. Sometimes, we use leaders and managers synonymously. One big different betweena leader and a
        manager is that leaders have followers and managers have direct reports. Not every manager is a leader but in some organizations,
        leaders are also managers.

        In this article, I am going to discus come management styles I have seen (not all styles of course) throughout my career.
        We will also touch base on exploration vs exploitation. There are leaders who are explorers are innovators who lead people
        to find new places or ideas. Lewis and Clark Expedition and Apple under Steve Jobs are exaples of innovation
        <b>lead</b> by an explorer(s).
      </p>

In 1803, shortly after the Louisiana Purchase, president Thomas Jefferson started the mission to **explore** and to map the new territory
and a path to west. Lewis and Clark Expedition lead by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark was the first American
expedition to cross the wester portion of the United States. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark are examples of front leadership style
that well suited for their mission. In presiden Thomas Jefferson's words:
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition">
  It was impossible to find a character who to a complete science in botany, natural history, mineralogy & astronomy, joined the
  firmness of constitution & character, prudence, habits adapted to the woods & a familiarity with the Indian manners and character,
  requisite for this undertaking. All the latter qualifications Capt. Lewis has.
</blockquote>

Another example of a visionary leader is Steve Jobs. Whether you like Apple products or not, we cannot deny the fact that Apple as we know it
today would not exist if it wasn't for Job's leadership.

> Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things
they never thought they could

    As we discused a little earlier, Leaders and Management need different set of skills even though the names are often used
    interchangeably. Even though the two have some responsibilities and expectations in common, leader is the visionary who focuses
    on the long term goal and should not be bothered by smaller tasks. Leader's job is to sell that vision to clients, employees
    and managers. Managers, on the other hand, have more freedom when it comes to communicating that vision to employees and assign
    tasks to help the employees and the company reach its goal.

    Before we dive deeper in leadership styles, it's important to understand <b>What leadership is not?</b> Simply, if no one is following,
    you are not leading. One might think they are leaders, may even have the title but if they no not inspire and no one cares, then
    leading an army of one is not leadership! Leadership started when there are personal relationships, when leadership skills are required
    to guide the followers towards a goal.

Here are some questions to keep in mind while reading this article:

* What are the attributes of leaders who are Explorers from the Front, Side, and Back?
* What about attributes of leaders who are Exploiters from the Front, Side, and Back?
* What about the transition of a company or line of business in a company founded by an Explorer that is taken over by an Exploiter?
* Innovation is done by explorers. Operations is done by Exploiters.
**Is either one inherently good or evil?**


## Leading from front

    <blockquote>
      ....
      <br />
      Instead of writing them a "manual," as he'd originally planned, he sent an email that said, simply, "Don't ask me
      for permission. Do what you think is right." The unbearable stream of emails from the reps to Ferriss dried up
      overnight; meanwhile, customer service at the company improved dramatically. "It's amazing," he says,
      "how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them."
      And, as far too many can attest, how it halves when you take that responsibility and trust away.

    <p>
      In this style of leadership, leaders are steps ahead than their followers to make sure the task is doable
      before they ask others do them. You can detect this style in organizations when you see the leaders who are
      fully engaged and their also need to approve before any one takes a different approach to problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership is inspired by military. Orders are given, everyone agrees and follows the leader.
      Even though leading from front is well-suited for military or in time or crises, it's very limiting in
      organizations who are priding themselves in creativity. Leading from front, doesn't leave much room for
      creativity as followers are often told what to do.

## Sitting on the sideline

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src = "/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_sideline.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Successful managers know how to and must delegate, sideline leadership happens when they fail to do so.
      Leaders who "lead" from side, fail to trust their followers. It's easier for them to do the job rather than empower
      and trust others to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my experience, ego is high in this style and those who are new to leadership often fall in danger of falling
      into this category if they didn't have enough training or intuition. It takes time and practice to let go! You can
      detect this style of leadership when you see a leader, for example, works extra hours to make sure things are "ok"
      while he/she is on a break, if they take any! They tend to be nervous about leaving and often they are right, because,
      work will get piled up. The second the leader is back they have to work much harder to pike up the pile off the floor,
      because the followers didn't know what to do while their leader was gone. Team is hurting from lack of communication
      or understanding of the vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leaders are often burn out and tired, because they consider themselves as bullet proof.
    </p>
  </div>

## Leading from behind

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_behind.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Leading from behind is hard and a bit confusing for many people. It requires trust, flexibility, and some tolerance
      for failure. Leaders who lead from back, might be mistaken with those who are not engaging or not doing the work.
      When utilized properly, leading from behind is very empowering. Leaders are expected to provide a safety net for
      their followers to be creative and allow them to explore, do mistakes (in a safe environment) and grow.
      They are, however, always available to consult or take charge when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership is great for organizations who are big on creativity and pride themselves in growing
      future leaders. This also shifts the micromanagement style to followers holding themselves to high standards,
      because they are given authority, trust, and means to do the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      When leader observer followers from back, he or she also gets to see individual's strengths and weaknesses and can
      help them improve or assigning them tasks that best fits their strengths. The leader then has time to building a
      Successful and strong team which is self-organizing and can operate when they are left alone instead of
      micromanaging everything that has to be done in the way they have envisioned. The goal is to build a team that
      can innovate!
    </p>
    <p>
      One important key here is, leading from behind doesn't mean to leave people to whatever they want! Freedom is not
      absolute. Followers must have a clear vision of the goals and timeline. The expected result is known, the means
      to get there can be let up to the followers.
    </p>

## Visionary Leadership

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">

  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Visionary leadership is crucial in having a Successful organization. A visionary leader is hard to replace.
      It's important for the visionary leader to document their principals who that their succeeders can leave up to
      explanations and are able to learn and improve what made the organization Successful at some time. Otherwise, the
      organization will go through a difficult time, if they ever manage to survive. Therefore, one of the skills
      of a visionary leader is great communication!
    </p>
    <p>
      These leaders are not only creative and are able to be very direct and clear about their vision and thoughts
      but they are also great listeners. They understand that even though they are in a position to make the final
      decision, they may not always have the best or the most accurate idea. They actively listen to those around them
      and welcome, in fact encourage, their opinion with an open mind.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

## Micromanagers

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/micromanagement.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      That there always those who just CANNOT LET GO, the Micromanagers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Micromanagers not only have a hard time letting go but they actively resist delegation. They are often the becoming
      a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step. They get involved in other’s work without consulting
      them and provide too many direction. They do not setup or tolerate failure, they want to "force people to enter heavens!"
      Micromanagers, looking at the details of how a job gets done instead of the overall picture. They require constant
      detail reporting and attend every meetings to ensure no decision is made without their input. They push aside the
      experience and knowledge of colleagues and are often lead a demotivated team. Those who are highly skilled and creative
      will get pushed away and eventually leave the the team.

## Closing Thoughts

  As we talked about different organizations and leadership styles, it's important to point out some technics that helps
  leaders categorize their problems and how they are going to respond. David Snowden created a "sencemaking model",
  as apposed to categorizing model, aka. Cynefin model, in 1999, while he was working at IBM Global Services.

  Cynefin (/ˈkʌnɪvɪn/ KUN-iv-in), which means "place of your multiple belonging" in Welsh, describes five decision making
  domains: Obvious (Simple), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. Leaders can use this model to make sense of
  their situation, either project or people behaviour related.  Here is a breakdown each each domain:

  ![alt text](/assets/images/leadership_styles/cynefin_framework_by_Edwin_Stoop.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

### Obvious / Simple:
  The obvious state is the **Know Kowns** state. Meaning that the rules are in place, cause and effects are
  known or predictable and situation is stable. Here, we apply the best practices.

  Examples of Obvious Sense is Loan Payment Processing: "Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed
  35 percent of gross income."

### Complicated
  Known unknows
  analyze the response - apply good practice
  There are several ways of doing things if you have several experties. You apply good practice based on the experties

### Complex
  Unknown unknows
  system without cauzality - safe fail experience
  Successful => applify
  Fail => dump it

### Chaotic
  Shit hit the fan!
  enter deliberately => enovation
  enter accidently => we have to stabalize immediately
  act -> sense -> response
  any practice is nobel

### Disorder
  Don't know where you are
  we inetrprate according to our intepration
  boundry between sumple and chaotic is different. => fall over the adge in crises

  Cynefin = Habitat, haunt, acquainted, familiar
  1999 - Dave Snowden

  Weather we are a leader at a company, in the group of friends or home, all of can benefit from practicing leadership skills and know when we need to change our style.
