      Organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership.
      Leadership is the ability to set visions and influence followers, providing support and guidance, to achieve a goal.
      In some organizations, Leaders are also managers.

      But Leaders and Management need different set of skills even though the names are often used interchangeably.
      The key difference here is not evert manger is necessarily a strong leader! Eevn though the two have
      some responsibilities and expectations in common, leader is the visionary who focuses on the long term goal and
      should not be bothered by smaller tasks. Leader's job is to sell that vision to clients, employees and managers.
      Managers, on the other hand, have more freedom when it comes to communicating that vision to employees and assign
      tasks to help the employees and the company reach its goal.

        Before we dive deeper in leadership styles, it's important to understand <b>What leadership is not?</b><br />
        Simply, if no one is following, you are not leading (you might think you are leading, but you are not)!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's look at some leadership styles

      Leading from front
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        In this style of leadership, leaders are steps ahead than their followers to make sure the task is doable
        before they ask others do them. You can detect this style in organizations when you see the leaders who are
        fully engaged and their also need to approve before any one takes a different approach to problem solving.
        <br />
        This style of leadership is inspired by military. Orders are given, everyone agrees and follows the leader.
        Even though leading from front is well-suited for military or in time or crises, it's very limiting in
        organizations who are priding themselves in creativity. Leading from front, doesn't leave much room for
        creativity as followers are often told what to do.

      <blockquote>
        ....<br />
        Instead of writing them a "manual," as he'd originally planned, he sent an email that said, simply,
        "Don't ask me for permission. Do what you think is right." The unbearable stream of emails from the reps
        to Ferriss dried up overnight; meanwhile, customer service at the company improved dramatically.
        "It's amazing," he says, "how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and
        indicate that you trust them." And, as far too many can attest, how it halves when you take that responsibility
        and trust away. <br />

      Sitting on the sideline
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Successful managers know how to and must delegate, sideline leadership happens when they fail to do so.
      Leaders who "lead" from side, fail to trust their followers. It's easier for them to do the job rather than
      empower and trust others to do it.
      <br />
      From my experience, ego is high in this style and those who are new to leadership often fall in danger of falling
      into this category if they didn't have enough training or intuition. It takes time and practice to let go! You can
      detect this style of leadership when you see a leader, for example, works extra hours to make sure things are "ok"
      while he/she is on a break, if they take any! They tend to be nervous about leaving and often they are right, because,
      work will get piled up. The second the leader is back they have to work much harder to pike up the pile off the floor,
      because the followers didn't know what to do while their leader was gone. Team is hurting from lack of communication
      or understanding of the vision.
      <br />
      The Leaders are often burn out and tired, because they consider themselves as bullet proof.

      Leading from behind
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Leading from behind is hard and a bit confusing for many people. It requires trust, flexibility, and some tolerance
      for failure. Leaders who lead from back, might be mistaken with those who are not engaging or not doing the work.
      When utilized properly, leading from behind is very empowering. Leaders are expected to provide a safety net for
      their followers to be creative and allow them to explore, do mistakes (in a safe environment) and grow.
      They are, however, always available to consult or take charge when needed.
      <br />
      This style of leadership is great for organizations who are big on creativity and pride themselves in growing
      future leaders. This also shifts the micromanagement style to followers holding themselves to high standards,
      because they are given authority, trust, and means to do the job.
      <br />
      When leader observer followers from back, he or she also gets to see individual's strengths and weaknesses and can
      help them improve or assigning them tasks that best fits their strengths. The leader then has time to building a
      Successful and strong team which is self-organizing and can operate when they are left alone instead of
      micromanaging everything that has to be done in the way they have envisioned. The goal is to build a team that
      can innovate!
      <br />
      One important key here is, leading from behind doesn't mean to leave people to whatever they want! Freedom is not
      absolute. Followers must have a clear vision of the goals and timeline. The expected result is known, the means
      to get there can be let up to the followers.

      Visionary Leadership
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Visionary leadership is crucial in having a Successful organization. A visionary leader is hard to replace.
      It's important for the visionary leader to document their principals who that their succeeders can leave up to
      explanations and are able to learn and improve what made the organization Successful at some time. Otherwise, the
      organization will go through a difficult time, if they ever manage to survive. Therefore, one of the skills
      of a visionary leader is great communication!
      <br />
      These leaders are not only creative and are able to be very direct and clear about their vision and thoughts
      but they are also great listeners. They understand that even though they are in a position to make the final
      decision, they may not always have the best or the most accurate idea. They actively listen to those around them
      and welcome, in fact encourage, their opinion with an open mind.

      Micromanagers
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      That there always those who just CANNOT LET GO, the Micromanagers!
      <br />
      Micromanagers not only have a hard time letting go but they actively resist delegation. They are often the becoming
      a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step. They get involved in otherâ€™s work without consulting
      them and provide too many direction. They do not setup or tolerate failure, they want to "force people to enter heavens!"
      Micromanagers, looking at the details of how a job gets done instead of the overall picture. They require constant
      detail reporting and attend every meetings to ensure no decision is made without their input. They push aside the
      experience and knowledge of colleagues and are often lead a demotivated team. Those who are highly skilled and creative
      will get pushed away and eventually leave the the team.

        As we talked about different organizations and leadership styles, it's important to point out some technics that helps
        leaders categorize their problems and how they are going to respond. David Snowden created a "sencemaking model",
        as apposed to categorizing model, aka. Cynefin model, in 1999, while he was working at IBM Global Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cynefin (/ËˆkÊŒnÉªvÉªn/ KUN-iv-in), which means "place of your multiple belonging" in Welsh, describes five decision making
        domains: Obvious (Simple), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. Leaders can use this model to make sense of
        their situation, either project or people behaviour related.  Here is a breakdown each each domain:

    <div class="subsection_title">
      Obvious / Simple:
    </div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        The obvious state is the <b>Know Kowns</b> state. Meaning that the rules are in place, cause and effects are
        known or predictable and situation is stable. Here, we apply the best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of Obvious Sence is Loan Payment Processing: "Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed
        35 percent of gross income."

      Chaotic

    <div class="text">
      Shit hit the fan!
      enter deliberately => enovation
      enter accidently => we have to stabalize immediately
      act -> sense -> response
      any practice is nobel

      Disorder

      Weather we are a leader at a company, in the group of friends or home, all of can benefit from practicing leadership skills and know when we need to change our style.
