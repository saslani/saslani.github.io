## Leadership vs Management

If you answered A to most questions you have more of the management characteristics. 

Does your answers fit your role? If you are in a leadership position have more of the management Characteristics, or if you are a manager who wants to be more effective in managing teams or project read more to find out some differences between the two roles and some does/don't as a leader or a manager.

Organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership. In my opinion leadership is earned while management is appointed. Leadership is the ability to set visions and long-term goals. A leader influences followers and provide support and guidance in order to achieve those goals. In the business world, leadership also involves connecting the value consumers to the value producers. A true leader, has followers who are inspired by that leader and therefore want to follow him/her. He have mastered getting their ideas through instead of just being a tapper (tapper & listener). If you are wearing a c-suits, you should be a leaders and not manager.    

<div class="container">
  <div class="left text">
    Nonetheless the two have some responsibilities and expectations in common, and that is working together to use resources and skills in order to accomplish goals. Managers have more freedom when it comes to communicating that vision to employees and assign tasks to help the employees and the company reach its goal. A leader cannot be bothered b "hows". That's the job of a Manager. Manager focuses on a short term results and takes care of important details that. Another key difference between a manager and leader is that managers have direct reports, as opposed to followers.

    Not every manager is a leader but in some organizations, leaders are also managers. A c-suit who has management characteristics is under-performing. A manager who has more leadership characteristics is on their way to become leaders!

For the rest of article, I am going to discus come management styles I have seen (not all styles of course) throughout my career. We will also touch base on exploration vs exploitation. There are leaders who are explorers are innovators who lead people to find new places or ideas. Innovation is done by explorers. Operations is done by Exploiters. Lewis and Clark Expedition and Apple under Steve Jobs are examples of innovation <b>lead</b> by an explorer(s).
<blockquote cite="http://">
  If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. <i>– John Quincy Adams</i>
</blockquote>

In 1803, shortly after the Louisiana purchase, president Thomas Jefferson started the mission to **explore** and to map the new territory and a path to west. Lewis and Clark Expedition lead by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark was the first American expedition to cross the western portion of the United States. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark are examples of front leadership style that well suited for their mission. Their mission wouldn't have been accomplished if they where leading from the back (allowing their team to take their time to explore) or with micromanagement (to set every single details and make the team follow them exactly as they imagined things would be), nor side leadership (leave their team and do everything alone!). In president Thomas Jefferson's words:
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition">
  It was impossible to find a character who to a complete science in botany, natural history, mineralogy & astronomy, joined the firmness of constitution & character, prudence, habits adapted to the woods & a familiarity with the Indian manners and character, requisite for this undertaking. All the latter qualifications Capt. Lewis has. <i> – Thomas Jefferson</i>
</blockquote>

An example of a visionary leader, on the other hand, is Steve Jobs. Whether you like Apple products or not, we cannot deny the fact that Apple as we know it
today would not exist if it wasn't for Job's leadership. Steve Job's **innovation** changed the way we use our phones! Many phone today, iPhone or other brands, are not just used for phone calls or sending text massages. We use our phone to establish a video call across the earth. We pay our bills, read books, accept payments and much more.

> Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things
they never thought they could
> -- <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

But every innovation needs a great business person to create market and demand for the product. On the other hand side, Bill Gate  was an exploiter. Bill Gate took other's ideas and innovation and turned in to a product. Gate's job as a leader was to sell that vision to clients, employees and managers. He created a market and demand for his product. As he once said, if your business is not on the Internet, then your business will be out of business.


### Leadership and Management Styles
<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/styles.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    Before we dive deeper in leadership styles, it's important to understand <b>What leadership is not?</b> Simply, if no one is following, you are not leading. One might think they are leaders, they may even have the title but if they do not inspire and no one cares, then leading an army of one is not leadership! Leadership starts when there are personal relationships. That's when leadership skills are required to guide the followers towards a goal.
  </div>
</div>

For the rest of this article, here are some questions to keep in mind while reading this article:
* Are you a leader or a manager
* What type of organization do you have
* Do you have a timeline for your goals
* What about the transition of a company or line of business in a company founded by an Explorer that is taken over by an Exploiter?

### Leading from front

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_front.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      In this style of leadership, leaders are steps ahead of their followers to make sure the task is doable before they ask others do them. You can detect this style in organizations when you see the leaders who are fully engaged and their also need to approve before any one takes a different approach to problem solving. Lewis and Clark where explorers and front leaders as we discussed earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership is inspired by military and could be an effective style when there are not much room for errors or time is of essence. Orders are given, everyone agrees and follows the leader. Even though leading from front is well-suited for military or in time or crises, it's very limiting in organizations who are priding themselves in creativity. Leading from front, doesn't leave much room for creativity as followers are often told what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this style of leadership, even though the leaders need approval before any action is take they need to make sure to appreciate follower's work and trust their intuition. Active listening is specially important in effective front leadership. A front leader, opens the door, not only listen but encourage new ideas, acknowledge them, then makes the best decision with the information they have. They also gives credit to those participated. If a leader fails to do so, then he/she will be perceived as malicious and will loose trust and help of creative people.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Sitting on the sideline

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src = "/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_sideline.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Successful leaders know how to and must delegate, sideline leadership happens when they fail to do so. Leaders who "lead" from side, fail to trust their followers. It's easier for them to do the job rather than empower and trust others to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my experience, ego is high in this style and those who are new to leadership must watch out not to fall into this category specially if they didn't have enough training or intuition. It takes time and practice to let go! You can detect this style of leadership when you see a leader, for example, works extra hours to make sure things are "perfect" while he/she is on a break, if they take any! They tend to be nervous about leaving and often they are right, because, work will get piled up. The second the leader is back they have to work much harder to pick up the pile off the floor,
      because the followers didn't know what to do while their leader was gone. Team is hurting from lack of communication or understanding of the vision. The Leaders are often burn out and tired. They consider themselves as bullet proof, things well get done even if they have to be up all night every night. A side-leader often blames things on the incompetency of the team rather than look deep to find the root cause of the problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style is leadership is very dangerous and ineffective. The team will feel disconnected. Even if the project succeeds the won't feel the win. Followers may have low job satisfaction because they may feel they didn't do their job. The other risk is the leader holds most of the knowledge and therefore will be hard for the employer to fire him or her. When the leader decides to leave the company, however, the project or the company will feel the pain.
    </p>

### Leading from behind

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_behind.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <blockquote>
      ....
      <br />
      Instead of writing them a "manual," as he'd originally planned, he sent an email that said, simply, "Don't ask me
      for permission. Do what you think is right." The unbearable stream of emails from the reps to Ferriss dried up
      overnight; meanwhile, customer service at the company improved dramatically. "It's amazing," he says,
      "how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them."
      And, as far too many can attest, how it halves when you take that responsibility and trust away.
      <br />
      ....
      <br />

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Leading from behind is hard and a bit confusing for many people. It requires trust, flexibility, and some tolerance for failure. Leaders who lead from back, might be mistaken with those who are not engaging or not doing the work. When utilized properly, leading from behind is very empowering. Leaders are expected to provide a safety net for their followers to be creative and allow them to explore, do mistakes (in a safe environment) and grow.
      They are, however, always available to consult or take charge when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership has become my favorite when circumstances are right. It is great for organizations who are big on creativity and pride themselves in growing future leaders. This style also shifts the micromanagement to followers holding themselves to high standards, because they are given authority, trust, and means to do the job "right".
    </p>
    <p>
      When leader observers followers from back, he or she also gets to see individual's strengths and weaknesses and can help them improve or assigning them tasks that best fits their strengths. The leader then has time to building a successful and strong team which is self-organizing and can operate when they are left alone instead of micromanaging everything that has to be done in the way they have envisioned. The goal is to build a team that
      can innovate!
    </p>
    <p>
      One important key here is, leading from behind doesn't mean to leave people to whatever they want! Freedom is not absolute. Followers must have a clear vision of the goals and timeline. The expected result is known, the means to get there can be let up to the followers.
    </p>
  </div>

### Visionary Leadership

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_visionary.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Visionary leadership is crucial in having a successful organization. A visionary leader is an innovator and is hard to replace. It's important for the visionary leader to document their principals so that their successors can follow. In an event that the visionary successful steps down or in Steve Job passes away, the successor and the followers need to refer to the principals to help the organization survive. Otherwise, the organization will go
      through a difficult time, if they ever manage to survive. Therefore, one of the skills of a visionary leader is great communication!
    </p>
    <p>
      Visionary leaders are not only creative and are able to be very direct and clear about their vision and thoughts but they are also great listeners. They understand that even though they are in a position to make the final decision, they may not always have the best or the most accurate idea. They actively listen to those around them and welcome, in fact encourage, their opinion with an open mind.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

### Micromanagers

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/micromanagement.jpg" />
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      And... there always those who just CANNOT LET GO, the Micromanagers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Micromanagers not only have a hard time letting go but they actively resist delegation. They often become a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step. They get involved in other’s work without consulting them and provide too many direction. They do not setup or tolerate failure, they want to "force people to enter heavens!" Micromanagers, looking at every single details of how a job gets done instead of the overall picture. They require constant detail reporting and attend every meeting to ensure no decision is made without their input. They push aside the experience and knowledge of colleagues and are often lead a demotivated team. Those who are highly skilled and creative will get pushed away and eventually leave the the team.
      <br />
      This by far is my least style of <b>management</b>. In fact, I don't consider micromanagers leader or managers, they are the bottleneck!
    </p>

## Situations that Need Leadership

Having leadership is not just knowing who to manage people. Great leaders have build skills to understand the situation they are in and how to guide the team effectively in order to get the best outcome. David Snowden created a "sensemaking model", as apposed to categorizing model, aka. Cynefin model, in 1999, while he was working at IBM Global Services.

Cynefin (/ˈkʌnɪvɪn/ KUN-iv-in), which means "place of your multiple belonging" in Welsh, describes five decision making domains: Obvious (Simple), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. Leaders can use this model to make sense of their situation, either project or people behavior related.  Here is a short breakdown each each domain:

![](/assets/images/leadership_styles/cynefin_framework_by_Edwin_Stoop.jpg)

### Obvious / Simple:
The obvious state is the **Know Knowns** state. Meaning that the rules are in place, cause and effects are known or predictable and situation is stable. Here, we apply the **best** practices or **sense-categories-respond**. Examples of Obvious Sense is loan payment processing: "Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income." Or, when you buy a product you pay the price that's set by the seller (in some cases you need to pay the tax on top of that price as well). This state has an exception that we will discuss at the end.

### Complicated
This is the state of **Known Unknowns**. There are multiple ways of doing things. The approach is not easy and needs expertise. The relationship between cause and effect are known even though not everyone can see it. The rule here to **sense-analyze-respond** and then apply a **good** practice based on the expertise. This the category which engineers, surgeons, and lawyers fall into.

Strong leadership is a key here. The experts have spent time developing knowledge around a certain skills. A leader needs to make sure to balance everyone's ideas and understand the intention behind the experts suggestions. The complicated state may take a long time. If done right, the team can move clockwise to the obvious state otherwise they may fall back into the complex state.


### Complex
Cynefiv complex is the **Unknown Unknowns** state. In this stage pattern don't exist, they should be built. The relationships, cause and effects need to be discovered. You won't even though the right questions to ask, this is where you just dump everything on the floor to start making sense out it. Some examples are hard insurance cases or the market. In this domain the approach is **probe-sense-respond**. Gather knowledge, make sense out of it, analyze and determine the next step.

### Chaotic
This is the **unknowable unknowns** domain, aka, Shit hit the fan! We have entered here accidentally and need to stabilize it immediately. Something has fallen of the rails and needs immediate attention. There's no time experiment or make patterns, the approach is to stop building or **act-sense-respond**.
Example of a chaotic situation is the 9/11 catastrophe. This domain needs a strong leadership who can bring everyone together and find an immediate solution to make the situation better. However, the leader should specially careful not to form ego and take credit if they are able to successfully control the catastrophe.

### Disorder
Last but not the least is the Disorder or **Not Determined** domain. This is when you don't know where you are. The priority here is together as much information as you can in order to determine which of the 4 domains you fall into.


Pay attention to the Cynefin model again. You notice there's a thin border between the domains. Geberally, when moving clockwise things are improving and vice versa. Pay close attention to the button domains. The border between obvious and chaotic is just as thin. When leaders in obvious domain become arrogant, stop paying attention to changes or details, and stop discovering there will be a sudden and catastrophic shift into chaotic domain.


Below is an example of Leader's framework for policing protest, using Cynefin model:
