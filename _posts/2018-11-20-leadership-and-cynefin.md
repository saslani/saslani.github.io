# Leadership and Cynefin

Having leadership is not just knowing who to manage people. Great leaders have build skills to understand the situation they are in and how to guide the team effectively in order to get the best outcome. David Snowden created a "sensemaking model", as apposed to categorizing model, aka. Cynefin model, in 1999, while he was working at IBM Global Services.

Cynefin (/ˈkʌnɪvɪn/ KUN-iv-in), which means "place of your multiple belonging" in Welsh, describes five decision making domains: Obvious (Simple), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. Leaders can use this model to make sense of their situation, either project or people behavior related.  Here is a short breakdown each each domain:

### Obvious / Simple:
The obvious state is the **Know Knowns** state. Meaning that the rules are in place, cause and effects are known or predictable and situation is stable. Here, we apply the **best** practices or **sense-categories-respond**. Examples of Obvious Sense is loan payment processing: "Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income." Or, when you buy a product you pay the price that's set by the seller (in some cases you need to pay the tax on top of that price as well). This state has an exception that we will discuss at the end.

### Complicated
This is the state of **Known Unknowns**. There are multiple ways of doing things. The approach is not easy and needs expertise. The relationship between cause and effect are known even though not everyone can see it. The rule here to **sense-analyze-respond** and then apply a **good** practice based on the expertise. This the category which engineers, surgeons, and lawyers fall into.

Strong leadership is a key here. The experts have spent time developing knowledge around a certain skills. A leader needs to make sure to balance everyone's ideas and understand the intention behind the experts suggestions. The complicated state may take a long time. If done right, the team can move clockwise to the obvious state otherwise they may fall back into the complex state.


### Complex
Cynefiv complex is the **Unknown Unknowns** state. In this stage pattern don't exist, they should be built. The relationships, cause and effects need to be discovered. You won't even though the right questions to ask, this is where you just dump everything on the floor to start making sense out it. Some examples are hard insurance cases or the market. In this domain the approach is **probe-sense-respond**. Gather knowledge, make sense out of it, analyze and determine the next step.

### Chaotic
This is the **unknowable unknowns** domain, aka, Shit hit the fan! We have entered here accidentally and need to stabilize it immediately. Something has fallen of the rails and needs immediate attention. There's no time experiment or make patterns, the approach is to stop building or **act-sense-respond**.
Example of a chaotic situation is the 9/11 catastrophe. This domain needs a strong leadership who can bring everyone together and find an immediate solution to make the situation better. However, the leader should specially careful not to form ego and take credit if they are able to successfully control the catastrophe.

### Disorder
Last but not the least is the Disorder or **Not Determined** domain. This is when you don't know where you are. The priority here is together as much information as you can in order to determine which of the 4 domains you fall into.


Pay attention to the Cynefin model again. You notice there's a thin border between the domains. Geberally, when moving clockwise things are improving and vice versa. Pay close attention to the button domains. The border between obvious and chaotic is just as thin. When leaders in obvious domain become arrogant, stop paying attention to changes or details, and stop discovering there will be a sudden and catastrophic shift into chaotic domain.

## Separate article: Leadership survey

Are you a technical leader, a manager, or an individual contributor? I'm not talking about your title...I'm talking about how the people on your team likely perceive you. Sometimes titles and perception of the role someone fills don't align.

We have organized a Google Survey to walk you through a series of questions to help you figure this out. Before we start, please take time to complete the Google survey. Your response is completely anonymous. Keep your answers in mid while reading though this article.

# link to the Google survey

If you answered A to most questions you have more Management characteristics. 

Does your answers fit your role? If you are in a leadership position have more of the management Characteristics, or if you are a manager who wants to be more effective in managing teams or project read more to find out some differences between the two roles and some does/don't as a leader or a manager.
