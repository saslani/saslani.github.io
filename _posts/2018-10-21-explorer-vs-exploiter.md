# Separate article: Leaders that are Explorers, Leaders that are Exploiters

For the rest of article, I am going to discus come management styles I have seen (not all styles of course) throughout my career. We will also touch base on exploration vs exploitation. There are leaders who are explorers are innovators who lead people to find new places or ideas. Innovation is done by explorers. Operations is done by Exploiters. Lewis and Clark Expedition and Apple under Steve Jobs are examples of innovation <b>lead</b> by an explorer(s).

In 1803, shortly after the Louisiana purchase, president Thomas Jefferson started the mission to **explore** and to map the new territory and a path to west. Lewis and Clark Expedition lead by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark was the first American expedition to cross the western portion of the United States. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark are examples of front leadership style that well suited for their mission. Their mission wouldn't have been accomplished if they where leading from the back (allowing their team to take their time to explore) or with micromanagement (to set every single details and make the team follow them exactly as they imagined things would be), nor side leadership (leave their team and do everything alone!). In president Thomas Jefferson's words:
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition">
  It was impossible to find a character who to a complete science in botany, natural history, mineralogy & astronomy, joined the firmness of constitution & character, prudence, habits adapted to the woods & a familiarity with the Indian manners and character, requisite for this undertaking. All the latter qualifications Capt. Lewis has. <i> – Thomas Jefferson</i>
</blockquote>

An example of a visionary leader, on the other hand, is Steve Jobs. Whether you like Apple products or not, we cannot deny the fact that Apple as we know it
today would not exist if it wasn't for Job's leadership. Steve Job's **innovation** changed the way we use our phones! Many phone today, iPhone or other brands, are not just used for phone calls or sending text massages. We use our phone to establish a video call across the earth. We pay our bills, read books, accept payments and much more.

> Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things
they never thought they could
> -- <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

But every innovation needs a great business person to create market and demand for the product. On the other hand side, Bill Gate  was an exploiter. Bill Gate took other's ideas and innovation and turned in to a product. Gate's job as a leader was to sell that vision to clients, employees and managers. He created a market and demand for his product. As he once said, if your business is not on the Internet, then your business will be out of business.
