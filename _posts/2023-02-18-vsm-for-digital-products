Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a powerful tool for organizations looking to improve their efficiency and customer satisfaction by identifying and eliminating waste in their processes. It is a visual representation of the flow of materials and information required to bring a product or service from concept to customer. The outcome of VSM can help teams identify bottlenecks in their processes and develop strategies to eliminate them.

For some, it’s easier to understand the value of VSM when talking about physical products. Physical products often need to be ordered, measured, customized, built, pass the quality assurance individually, get shipped, etc. Hence, it could take days if not weeks for the customer to see the end product. When talking about days and weeks, it’s easier to imagine eliminating processes to shorten that time even by a couple of days to ensure customer’s satisfaction. 

For the rest of this article I will go over how to apply VSM for your digital product, with some examples.

Value Stream Mapping is just as important for digital products and services. Imagine building a trading platform. Now instead of talking about days, we’re talking about milliseconds and nanoseconds. When working within such tight constraints, you need to consider everything from the API language and technology of choice, to every algorithm you are running, the operating system where the API will be running in, the location of the server(s), length of the cables etc. In such an environment, how do you find waste? Applying VSM lessons at a different scale would help you find and eliminate waste (or memory leaks) just like in physical products. 

In their book “Learn to See” Jim Womack and Dan Jones, point out that “many readers of “Lean Thinking” have deviated from the step by step transformation process, that is skipping step 4: “Map the entire value stream for all of your product families”
1. Find a change agent
2. Find a sensei
3. Seize a crisis to motivate action across your firm
4. Map the entire value stream for all of your product families
5. Pick something important and get started removing waste quickly, to surprise yourself with how much you can accomplish in a very short period

Skipping the 4th step would lead into the company or the teams focusing on a wrong thing. Incidentally, something that the highest paid person in the room “feels” strongly that it’s the right thing to do, causing the HPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) process. In these scenarios the order comes from the “top” and teams might feel it’s “above their pay grade” to question it. The orders often come with a timestamp attached to it and the teams need to deliver or else… that’s oftentime without considering the team’s skills and other priorities. Rushing to “pick something important and get started moving waste quickly” without the understanding of VSM (or Material and Information Flow” as Jim Womack and Dan Jones put it in their “Learn to See” book) could lead to disappointment, a failed mission, money and time loss, loss of trust in management, burnout, layoffs, etc.
Instead of the HPPO process, spend a couple of days laying out the highlevel VSM of a “product family” or the process you need to improve on. If you are new to the team, just ask the team members about the product they are building to get started:
- What data do you consume 
- Where is the data you are consuming is coming from
- What data do you produce
- Who consumes your data

This allows you to start building an “imperfect model that makes sense!” - Pragmatic Dave Thomas. Afterall, “all models are wrong, some are useful” - George E. P. Box

The process of VSM begins by mapping the current state of the value stream, which includes all 1activities required to design, produce, and deliver a product or service .It is important to understand the current state in order to identify areas where waste is present. Once the current state is understood, teams can identify areas where waste is present, such as excess inventory, unnecessary steps, or delays. Once these areas of waste have been identified, the next step is to create a future state map that eliminates the waste and improves the flow of materials and information. By implementing the future state, organizations can reduce lead times, increase efficiency, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

One tweak I introduce here is to use Jeff Patten’s product leadership lessons to identify the North Star, first. Especially if you are “modernizing” your platform. Thinking about the ideal product will help you identify your next step and move in the right direction. Even if that right direction means putting your existing product in “maintenance mode” and focusing on building the new product right. Once you know what the desired product is (this could be triggering and trade in XX milliseconds which is XX% improvement to what you already have) go back and start on mapping the current state of the value stream.

While in the world of physical products, the person who’s building the VSM can carry a clock and time things pretty accurately, the world of digital products could be more complicated. Consider our trading platform again when milliseconds are important! So, when building a VSM for products that timing is important:
- Start by logging and benchmarking
- Use dashboards i.e. Datadog, Grafana, Prometheus, etc to visualize the data at every state of the process
- Verify that the metrics are correct 
- Understand what’s the norm, what falls into 99 and 99.99 percentile
- Diversify: this could be considering how the data change:
	- During a special time of the year
	- Time of the day
	- Certain location
	- News events etc.
- Look for patterns

You might think the steps above will take more than just a couple of days and you are right. But yet again, if you don’t have this information, you won’t be able to have a proof where the waste is happening. So, start somewhere!

Implementing VSM can be a challenging process, but the benefits are well worth it. By identifying and eliminating waste in your processes, you can reduce lead times, increase efficiency, and improve overall customer and stakeholders’ satisfaction. Value Stream Mapping is not a one time process. Iterative feedback and response is important to keep the product up-to-date. Once you have the first VSM created, make it easy for the team to maintain it. The best way for this is to assign a person to always take the responsibility to ensure the map reflects accurate information. 

In conclusion, Value Stream Mapping is a powerful tool that helps organizations identify and eliminate waste in their processes, it's a visual representation of the flow of materials and information required to bring a product or service from concept to customer. By understanding the current state of your value stream and identifying areas of waste, you can create a future state that eliminates the inefficiencies and improves the flow of materials and information. Through VSM, organizations can reduce lead times, increase efficiency, and improve overall customer satisfaction. VSM also helps teams to collaborate more effectively.
