Why am I writing this article?

Warning: this article is not for those who believe in Young Earth creationism, dinosaur bones are real!

- There has been a lot of talk about leadership around me..
- Observed great leadership that the leader enables employees to do what's right to do, and steps in only if help is needed
- Observed questionable leadership that's more "boss like"
- Why am I interested in this topic
- Our parents were committed to 1 company, if our generation sticks around for more than 2-3 years we celebrate. Loyalty is chaning
- The contract between companies and employees are changing.

  <title>Organization History</title>

  <div class="container">
    Before we jump into why we need organization and leadership let’s take a quick walk into where we came from and why our
    genus Homo Sapiens succeed.
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      The sapiens thought to have merged around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Roughly around 200,000 years ago Homo sapiens
      became recognizable. They evolved in Africa and migrated somewhere around 90,000 years ago. Homo sapiens developed
      capacity for language only around 50,000 years ago. Our ancestors migrated from Africa to Successfuly populate the
      world, including to Europe where Neanderthals has already been settled.

      <p>
        There are several hypothesis as why sapiens succeeded but not neanderthals even though neanderthals were physically
        stronger and faster in short distance run. Some of those hypothesis include: violence from modern human, diseases,
        competitive exclusion, inbreeding, climate change or a combination of these and more...
      </p>
      <p>
        One hypothesis that relates to this article is <b>the brain power</b>.
        <br />
        Neanderthals had brawn but humans advantage on brains. Sapiens brain were built to support more complex functions
        such as creativity, communication and imagination. In short, one explanation is that imaginations, ability to believe
        myth and fictions, and ability to mass communicate (storytelling) became our ancestors biggest advantage.

      Another example of human’s creative mind is religion. We are capable of believing in supernatural. Our creative mind
      allows us to believe in extraordinary things like God with unlimited power and so kind who is also tolerant of all the
      suffering in the world. We have communicated those belief and created a community around it. Hence, one of human’s
      biggest invention is region!

  <title>socialization</title>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Human are also social animals. But what is socialization and are they limits to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking too much in biology, let's look back, once again, evolution supports socialization (sorry introverts,
      including myself!). If father and mother stayed around longer, children had a better chance of surviving. Larger
      families and tribes could also better defend themselves against intruders.

      <p>
        If one has to only answer to themselves and can do whatever they want, can we call it a team or an organization?
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when we add a second person to the team? Now we have links n*(n-1)/2
        The moment we add a second person, we have a team dynamics, it’s a small team but it is at last a team
      </p>
      <p>
        Now come a few hundred thousands forward, what team size is right?

        In the following context, let's define relationship as knowing well who each person is and how are they related to
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though human are social, there’s limit to our social skills which we can have a meaningful, stable and cohesive
        relationship with others.
        The real number falls somewhere between 100 to 250, commonly <b>150</b>.
        <br />
        The formula above was first proposed in 1990 by an anthropologist name Robin Dunbar as the Primate brain size and
        average of social group size.

        Durban suggests that a number larger than this requires restrictions, laws and enforced norms to maintain a
        <b>stable</b> and <b>cohesive</b> group. In other words, our brain struggles to make meaningful and stable
        relationships when the number is greater than Durbin’s number. That’s why we cannot trust strangers and that’s why
        we form tribes, organization and governments.
      </p>

        Now, we are entering the Complex Adaptive System subject. Which is a system in which a perfect understanding of the
        individual parts does not automatically convey a perfect understanding of the whole system's behavior.

  <title>Organization Structure</title>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Before we start talking about leadership styles and their effectiveness let's take a look at different organizations
        throughout the history. Considering evolution, we see that we have evolved from small groups of family to survive to
        build today’s mega city and civilization. We went from staying together in group of dozens to have our species
        survive and pass our genes. To understanding biology and manipulating our genes! But, we couldn't have came so far
        if we had stayed in our small family circle or tribes. Forming bigger groups and organizations allowed us to shift
        our attention from just survival to understanding the world around us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book “reinventing organization” groups the organizations’ involvement as the following:

        Organizations don't exist at this stage, yet. However, tribes of few hundred started forming.
        Elders had special status (walking libraries) because of their experience and knowledge.
        Humanity shifted to stage of consciousness. This was a magical time because human started believing in magics.
        However, Cause and effect are poorly understood. Some describe this ara as when our sensorimotor started developing.
        The behavior of human in magic magenta time is describe as for a 24-month old toddler: biting finger vs biting a toy

      Some time around 10,000 years ago leaders started ruling by force and fear. The group size was well above
      Dunbar’s number. The tribes realized that they have to use control to defend ourselves.
      Ego started to form, individuals had a sense of self that separates them from others. Tribes were subsisting
      on horticulture which was the start of civilization, and eventually institutions.

      We still see examples of impulsive red in today's era. Wars, Prison, Gangs and Mafia, are all examples of impulsive red.

        Within the past couple of centuries, humankind have evolved far beyond absolute right or wrong. We started
        to understand and handle greater complexity. This was the start of industrial revolution. We understood machines and
        as a result, started making our organizations like machines. If you look closely at most leaders in business and
        politics worldwide, you see they are operating in achievement orange organizations. Other examples of this group are
        corporations such as Walmart and Coca-Cola.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achievement orange organizations' effectiveness is through
        <b>innovation</b>, <b>accountability</b>, and <b>meritocracy</b>.
        <br />
        This is the time that organizations started having research and development, marketing,
        and product management departments.
        The traditional <b>Command and Control</b> is now shifted to <b>Predict and Control</b>. Managers set achievement
        target for their employees and those who reach their target are getting rewarded by being promoted
        or getting a salary raise or bonus.

    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Pluralistic green organizations are still relatively new, they started forming in the current century while
        orange is still dominant in politics and businesses. The break though here is <b>empowerment</b>! The organizations
        still operate in pyramid hierarchy but managers push through majority voting and are expected to share power.
        Examples of green organizations are academic thinking, nonprofits, social workers, and community activists.
        Some organizations who are also early adopters of pluralistic green are Southwest Airlines, and Ben and Jerry's.
        <br />
        Another noticeable change in pluralistic green organizations is that management style has shifted from
        being a boss to modest behavior. This modesty is a result of understanding and respecting other people's feelings.
        Not only manager are expected to be respectful and open minded, green organizations also invest in
        soft-skill trainings for their employees.
        <br />
        Green organizations practice 360-degree reviews, meaning not only managers review their employees, employees also
        get to review their managers and provide feedback and improvements.
        <br />
        Culture is very important, for example Southwest believes in Freedom, and Ben and Jerry's pride themselves for
        caring about Environment.
        <br />
        The downside of green organizations is that even though they pride themselves as being open minded and tolerant.
        They are also intolerant of those who don't fit their "culture!"

        There is an evolution in consciousness, that there is a momentum in evolution towards ever more complex and
        refined ways of dealing with the world. In this stage, we are now well aware of complexity.
        Instead of either-or there is both-and. We must combine and process information in a new way that disidentify

        As the name implies, teal organizations have an <b>evolutionary purpose</b>. Instead of looking at 5 years ahead
        and plan for the year, they look 20 years ahead and plan for tomorrow. In order to achieve their goal, creating
        smarter groups are essential. These group focuses on increasing in emotional intelligence and therefore increasing

        So far, we looked into the history of groups and organizations. We understood why we're social and why forming teams
        was essential to our survival. Also, as Dunbar suggests as our teams and organizations got bigger the need for leaders
        grow. Not only just a leader, but also the leadership style. In a modern society a company who wants to run their
        organization like an impulsive red is not going to survive. Meanwhile, military cannot operate in pluralistic green or
        evolutionary teal, especially during war!
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for us to determine what type of organization we have or want, and how our leaders should operate, let's
        take a loop at some leadership styles. We have to decide what organization we want before we have a shanty town.
        Who sets the goal and the vision and what are we here to achieve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Across all these styles, a strong leader not only is setting a long term vision on how life is going to be
        in 5, 10, 20 years from now, but makes sure that the employees are well-aware of the goals and empowers them to
        get there. Setting goals is an expectation for leaders but it's equally important to understand how do a
