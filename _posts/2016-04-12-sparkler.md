I recently started a project in which I need to build several RESTful API's and microservices in Java. I wanted to find or build a framework, or at least a reference application. At the end of the day, I wanted an API with a dead simple domain just to show what it would take to build something deployable in a real-world way. When I started scoping out the architecture, I thought about the fact that the last Java REST API I'd built from scratch was in 2012. I'd developed a few in Rails and Sinatra-based API's in the meantime, though, and I wanted a similar developer experience in Java.

Allow me to introduce you to [Sparkler](https://github.com/saslani/sparkler)! Sparkler was developed by two software engineers, Sarah Aslanifar (myself) and [Bobby Norton](http://bobbynorton.com/), as a way for us to show people a working example of the design principles we wanted when building Java web applications. You can check out the README for details about how to get started, but this article is an introduction about why we built it along with some of the design principles and values we employed.


### The Server and REST API: Spark Framework

Not to be confused with the distributed computing framework Apache Spark, this is the relatively new Java Web Application "microframework". Based on the design principles of Sinatra and leveraging the functional programming potential of Java 8, Spark proved to be a fantastic foundation for the stack I wanted to build. After spending a couple of hours experimenting with one of Frederico Tomassetti's [well-written tutorial](https://sparktutorials.github.io/2015/04/03/spark-lombok-jackson-reduce-boilerplate.html), I was ready to extend Spark with my own ideas.
