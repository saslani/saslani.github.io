This is just my story on how we're adapting to social isolation and homeschooling. Every family is different, so this blog is not meant to give anyone advice about “the right way” of working from home or homeschooling... 

What prompted me to write this article was when a friend (who's very loving and sweet and the best aunt, but doesn't have kids) gave us a great advice on how we should home-school our boys while WFH - it’s easy: let them know the hours they can come to you for questions and when they should not interrupt! Or print their daily schedule so they know what to do! Well, that sounds great, doesn’t it? And only if… I love you friend - but you have no idea!

So, I asked a couple of friends to write their stories down, again not to give advice but share their their way of handling this pandemic situation.

We are in the 4th month of [COVID19 and we haven’t reached the peak yet](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). It doesn’t surprise me if it takes at least 3-4 month till things are “back to normal”. That’s why it’s important for working parents to establish a routine that works for them. Not only that, but we might face similar situation again next school year... Or even this summer, when most working parents sign kids up for summer camp, who dares to do it this year?
<br />
It might take one family a day and another a month to find a routine that works for them. So don't feel bad if you haven't found what works for you, we're still working on it :)  

Here is how a few us us are WFH pandemic way. If you would like to share your story send me a message to sarah@testedminds.com and I will add your way to this article:

- [Sarah and Bobby: Both are software engineers](#Sarah&Bobby)
- [Cat: Software engineer](#Cat). Cat is a great and well known engineer, so I reached out to her to see how she's managing her time these days. I completely agree with her point about things really being different. We’re not looking at this as the chance to win a “Tiger parent of the year” award!

    <strong>My version:</strong>
    <br />
    When I was a Sr. in college, I thought I was busy.
    <br />
    Then I started my Masters degree while working full-time and then I thought now I am really busy.
    <br />
    Then it come the serious boyfriend and marriage, I laughed at my days in past, because I understood what being busy meant.
    <br />
    Then I had babies, and worked full-time, this is seriously so busy, I had so much time when I was working and studying my Masters.
    <br />
    <strong>Now comes the COVID19 pandemic!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Bobby's version:</strong>
    <br />
    "Daaa Ddy - Da Deee!" - sing song, playful
    <br />
    Now more seriously..."Daa DEE!"
    <br />
    And now...all pretense of civility gone...just raw desperation: "DADDY!" <strong>bang bang bang</strong>
</p>

...2020 was the year we were finally going to have a nice, sustainable routine. We moved to suburbs a couple of years ago and finally feel settled. Boys are finally in the same school. They're mostly independent in the mornings: getting breakfast, get ready for school, and head out for school together (the school is 4 minutes away). I leave around the same time to catch the train to Chicago for work.

On school days, the boys get home around 3:15 pm. Bobby can usually take a break and spend time with the boys. I usually get home around 6:15 pm. The family picks me up from the Metra station, and we vote on where to eat dinner. Often we go to one of our favorite local restaurants, and sometimes we cook at home. We catch up and talk about our day, sometimes squeeze in a little raiding with Pokemon Go.

The boys are in bed by 8 pm, on good nights, that gives Bobby and I some time to catch up, drink a bottle of wine, watch a movie, read a book, work on blogs or personal projects, etc. Finally, we have a routine and we all get some personal time too!!!

**THEN CAME COVID-19**
<br />
And Schools closing
<br />
And work from home
<br />
And social distancing ....

Thursday, March 12, 2020, right around 5:00 pm I was packing up my stuff at work when I suddenly got texts, VMs, emails about school closing. I sent a message to the team, notifying them about school closing and letting them know I'd be working from home. Right then, our CEO walked by. Shortly, he sent a message to everyone: "... if you are a parent and are dealing with school closures next week and childcare is an issue for you, please feel free to WFH for the duration of those closures...". At Tandem (where I work), we WFH on Wednesdays, so I am very well setup for remote work. However, the difference is, I had a quiet place to work from home on Wednesdays and I was about to lose that with homeschooling.

What went through my head was: It's just a week .. or two .. we got this! And before we know it, we're in week 5...

We tried many things, including, print daily schedule and leaving notes for the boys about what to do, and when we're busy. Simply it didn't work! It's not easy to work full-time and teach 2 kids at different grade levels (this is easily 3 full-time jobs) in addition to daily house chores, workout, etc.

**So how's work/life schedule pandemic way for us these days?**
<br/>
We are very fortunate to have a 2 floor house and a finished basement that we use as a playroom / TV room. As soon as the school-closing new came out, I converted our art table in the basement to a desk. We brought a 10-years old iMac that I cannot even update because it’s so old to the basement too, so both boys can use it for their homework. We made the basement the designated “home school”, while the main floor remained as the family area and my designated workspace remained upstairs. 

For the past few days that things have gone better
<br/>
- Bobby wakes up around 6 am and starts his work day
- Boys wake up at 7 am and they eat breakfast
- I wake up around 8:00 am and start my day. 
In the mornings, boys spend time with me since they tent to be more punctual and focused around me. One starts on his music or reading (which doesn't need a computer or my supervision) while the other camps in my office, next to my desk to use my personal laptop for school work that's being assigned weekly and daily by teachers and school district (in other words, the designate "home school" and iMac in the basement idea went right out the door!)

At 12:15 when my lunch time starts. This is the time that boys wrap on what they could get done for the day. I make lunch for the boys and update Bobby on the school work progress. Bobby takes over around 1 pm. He's definitely the fun parent! This is the time I have an uninterrupted time to get my work done while Bobby and the boys either play outside or get house chores done, "sometimes" they get a little more school work done.

I usually stop by 6 pm and join the family for dinner and family time. 
- Boys head to bed around 8 - 8:30 pm
- Bobby goes to bed by 9 pm
- I finish my work for the time lost in the morning. I try to tidy around then spend a little time reading or writing to unwind, heading to bed around midnight

And this is finally what's "working" for us after 5 weeks...

**What are we still struggling with?**
<br />
- Even though we're settling with our pandemic schedule, things are still very scary for the boys:
    - This year, Aidin made a couple of great friends that they live close by. It's so great to see their friendships blossom. He's at the age that understands social interactions and he loves it. Until COVID19, we were teaching him to shake hands, have play dates, etc, now we have to suddenly revert all those and tell him not to shake hands, we can’t have play dates, and you have to stay 6 feet away from other people...
    - Armin was very scared for the first couple of weeks. The reality of school closing, no more play in the park, no going to music class, recital and music graduation cancellation etc was very hard for him to understand.  He often asked if we were going to die. But he's doing much better now. He learned to cook a couple of things (eggs and mac & Cheese) and he's practicing playing guitar on his head!
- Due to the current schedule, Bobby and I don't have much time together :(
- Our weekends are at list 50% catching up on either work or house chores.

#### Cat: Engineer
#### Partner: Works for an electrical utility company and still has to travel
#### Children: Ray (7)

In some ways, I am really lucky. My employer supports work from home, and they have even introduced new guidelines to support parents balancing work and childcare responsibilities. For example, it's suggested meetings start five minutes after the hour and conclude five minutes before the top of the next hour in order to provide parents with the chance to check in on the kiddos. This is helpful for me because I am home alone with my son. My partner works for an electrical utility company, and apparently people still need electricity even during isolation. He has been traveling all over the state. It's stressful being home alone, and of course, my son and I worry about Dad traveling and not being able to isolate. 

We are settling into a little bit of routine at home. I wake up at 4:30 am to catch up on work and to-dos. When my son wakes up, I fix him breakfast and he writes in his journal. I usually have some materials prepared based on whatever questions he asked me the day before. For example, one day he asked me about dirigibles and the next day I had pulled together some things for him like information on the Hindenburg, some related math problems, etc. Then I go out to the office we have out in our rec room. It's separate from the rest of the house, and I consider that a huge advantage. Based on the advice of Devorah Heitner, I don't let Ray play video games until the afternoon, but I let him do basically anything else eg. slip n slide, play in the treehouse, bake, whatever. His grandma usually video calls him sometime after 1 pm, and they have been learning to play Animal Crossing together. They've been reading a day by day guide together and trying to work through the things in that guide. At about 5 pm, I wrap up work. We eat dinner and clean up the house. Before bed, we've been watching His Dark Materials. Even though my partner isn't home, watching a streaming TV show is an activity he can do with us. 

Overall, I am just trying to be realistic. I am not trying to go about work and school the same way we did before. We are all in this together. We should be gentle with ourselves and with each other.
