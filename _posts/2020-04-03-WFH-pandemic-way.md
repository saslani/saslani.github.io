When I was a sr. in college, I thought I was so busy.
Then I started my MS degree while working full-time and then I thought now I am really busy.
Then it come the serious boyfriend and marriage, I laughed at my days in past, because I understood what being busy meant.
Then I had babies, and worked full-time, this is seriously so busy, I had so much time when I was working and studying my MS.


CURRENT COVID19 SITUATION AND STATS

Short paragraph of how we were

Cat's 



My sons are 6 and 8 years old, finally we have routine. They're independent in the mornings, for the most part, Armin (8 yo) learned to make breakfast and he's enjoying it. Boys getup around 6:30-7 am and finally entertain themselves instead of running into our room and wake Bobby and I up! I finally have time to myself. My employer is great and values work/life balance, so no work outside of office hours is encouraged. 

On school days, boys get home around 3:15, that's when Bobby's often done with work and spends time with the boys. Or if he has to work longer, boys entertain themselves with toys, music etc.

I usually get home around 6:15 pm . Family picks me up from the Metra station, we vote on where to eat dinner. Often we go to our local favorite restaurant, once in a while boys vote to cook at home which is not Bobby and my strength, but we try. We catch up and talk about our day, sometime squeeze in a little pokemon hunting. Boys are in bed by 8 pm. Bobby and I have some time to catch up, eat a little extra ;), drink a bottle of wine, watch a movie, read a book, work on blogs or personal project etc. I am a night person, so some nights I like to stay up longer and paint, draw, read etc. Bobby prefers to sleep earlier and wake up early to start his day. 

Finally, we have a routine and we all get some personal time!!!

THEN IT CAME COVID-19
And Schools closing
And work from home
And social distancing ....

Seriously, nature had to show us who is the boss. Thursday 12, 2020, right around 5:00 pm I was packing up my stuff at work when I suddenly got texts, VMs, emails about school closing. I sent a message to the team, notifying them about school closing and letting them know I'd working from home. Right then, our CEO walked by. Shortly, he sent a message to everyone: "... if you are a parent and are dealing with school closures next week and childcare is an issue for you, please feel free to WFH for the duration of those closures..."

What went though my head was: It's just a week .. or two .. we got this:
- Friday: schools are closed, so they'll be good boys, I'll give them something to do and we can go out for lunch or dinner
- Next week: boys would be busy playing in the morning. School announced some kind of online classes or homework, boys can get busy with that and Bobby and I just tag team...it's just a week
- Week of March 21: schools are closed anyway, Bobby and I could decide who want to wake up early and who's going to bed late... 

We're in week 4 of no-school and social distancing.
- first week
    + School online - homework program
        * Aidin did well
        * Armin was independent and we couldn't setup his account
- week 2: spring break
    + Finally setup Armin's account and he caught-up on he had missed the week before
- week 3: 
    + We knew what to expect from kid's school but time management still remains and issue (much better on Friday, finally)
    + Bobby starts his day early and usually is spending time "playing" with the boys before lunch
    + Bobby often take time in the morning to also tidy the house
    + Lunch I come down. I make some lunch with the boys and start working form basement, if I can, so I can encourage them to do their homework. There has been several days that I had to take evening off (half day vacations) because the boys are very behind since they spent all morning playing. Or I make up for that time after the boys go to bed. 

^ is why there's not much personal time left anymore. As a introverted person as I am, sometimes I just stay up till 1-2am to read a book, write, work on some project.. otherwise, I cannot fall asleep

^ but I make sure either take vacation time or make up time for work

### Other
- I need personal space:
    + Some nights I just drive to a nearby park and go for a quick walk/run to get some Chicago's cold weather on my face. It helps me gather my thoughts
    + Bobby LOVES to play with the boys and complains about homework just as much as they are, if not more

This year, Aidin made a couple of great friends that they live close by. It's so great to see their friendship blossoms. He's at the edge that understands social interactions and he loves it. Till now we were teaching him to shake hands, have play dates etc now we have to suddenly revert all those and tell him no to shake hand, we cannot have play dates, you have to stay 6 feet away form other people etc

Armin was very scared for the first couple of weeks he often asked if we'd die...

### How else is it different from summer times
- At we work from home on Wednesdays, so we're all used to remote work and are doing a great job with it. On Wednesdays, when I work form home. I enjoy sitting in my home office, nice large desk, nice DWR chair, my nice curved monitor and an enjoyable quiet house that lets me focus and get what I need to get done, done

- Bobby would opt in working from the kitchen or the spare bedroom. We'd sometime sync our schedule to get lunch together. Boys get home around 3:15 which Bobby sometime would break from work to spend time with them - I often continued working

- Now WFH is not the quiet place that I'd get work done, even faster because I didn't have to worry about dressing up and commute
- We are interrupted many times / day

### we are lucky to have a large house
- Offices and work space downstairs
- family time: main floor
- basement school and play


------------------------------------

Another full-time working parent's story:

In some ways, I am really lucky. My employer supports work from home, and they have even introduced new guidelines to support parents balancing work and childcare responsibilities. For example, it's suggested meetings start five minutes after the hour and conclude five minutes before the top of the next hour in order to provide parents with the chance to check in on the kiddos. This is helpful for me because I am home alone with my son. My partner works for an electrical utility company, and apparently people still need electricity even during isolation. He has been traveling all over the state. It's stressful being home alone, and of course, my son and I worry about Dad traveling and not being able to isolate. 

We are settling into a little bit of routine at home. I wake up at 430am to catch up on work and to-dos. When my son wakes up, I fix him breakfast and he writes in his journal. I usually have some materials prepared based on whatever questions he asked me the day before. For example, one day he asked me about dirigibles and the next day I had pulled together some things for him like information on the Hindenburg, some related math problems, etc. Then I go out to the office we have out in our rec room. It's separate from the rest of the house, and I consider that a huge advantage. Based on the advice of Devorah Heitner, I don't let Ray play video games until the afternoon, but I let him do basically anything else eg slip n slide, play in the treehouse, bake, whatever. His grandma usually video calls him sometime after 1 pm, and they have been learning to play Animal Crossing together. They've been reading a day by day guide together and trying to work through the things in that guide. At about 5pm, I wrap up work. We eat dinner and clean up the house. Before bed, we've been watching His Dark Materials. Even though my partner isn't home, watching a streaming TV show is an activity he can do with us. 

Overall, I am just trying to be realistic. I am not trying to go about work and school the same way we did before. We are all in this together. We should be gentle with ourselves and with each other.
