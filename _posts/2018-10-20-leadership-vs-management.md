I've been thinking a lot about leadership lately. In particular, leadership vs. management. I think the best way for me to explore these thoughts is as a set of informal essays. This first comes from my observations about different styles of both leadership and management that I've experience over the last 15 years of my career in software development.

Organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership. In my opinion, leadership, like trust, is earned. Management can be assigned. Leadership involves setting visions and long-term goals...defining a strategy. A leader influences followers and provides support and guidance in order to empower and inspire them to achieve those goals. In the business world, leadership also involves connecting value consumers to value producers. A true leader has followers who are inspired by that leader and therefore _want_ to follow him or her. 

TODO: Tapper and Listener story
Communication

Leaders have mastered getting their ideas through instead of just being a tapper. If you're in a CxO role, you should be a leader, not a manager. You have managers that report to you, and your strategic intent for them needs to be crystal clear. They need to understand it, and organize their teams to achieve it.

    Nonetheless the two have some responsibilities and expectations in common, and that is working together to use resources and skills in order to accomplish goals. Managers have more freedom when it comes to communicating that vision to employees and assign tasks to help the employees and the company reach its goal. A leader cannot be bothered b "hows". That's the job of a Manager. Manager focuses on a short term results and takes care of important details that. Another key difference between a manager and leader is that managers have direct reports, as opposed to followers.

    Not every manager is a leader but in some organizations, leaders are also managers. A c-suit who has management characteristics is under-performing. A manager who has more leadership characteristics is on their way to become leaders!

### Leadership and Management Styles

      Before we dive deeper in leadership styles, it's important to understand <b>What leadership is not?</b> Simply, if no one is following, you are not leading. One might think they are leaders, they may even have the title but if they do not inspire and no one cares, then leading an army of one is not leadership! Leadership starts when there are personal relationships. That's when leadership skills are required to guide the followers towards a goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leadership is when the followers want to keep in touch with you. They come to you for advice and guidance, not to just give reports or when they have to.

For the rest of this article, here are some questions to keep in mind while reading this article:
* Are you a leader or a manager
* What type of organization do you have
* Do you have a timeline for your goals
* What about the transition of a company or line of business in a company founded by an Explorer that is taken over by an Exploiter?

### Leading from front

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">
    <img src="/assets/images/leadership_styles/leadership_front.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      In this style of leadership, leaders are steps ahead of their followers to make sure the task is doable before they ask others do them. You can detect this style in organizations when you see the leaders who are fully engaged and their also need to approve before any one takes a different approach to problem solving. Lewis and Clark where explorers and front leaders as we discussed earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership is inspired by military and could be an effective style when there are not much room for errors or time is of essence. Orders are given, everyone agrees and follows the leader. Even though leading from front is well-suited for military or in time or crises, it's very limiting in organizations who are priding themselves in creativity. Leading from front, doesn't leave much room for creativity as followers are often told what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this style of leadership, even though the leaders need approval before any action is take they need to make sure to appreciate follower's work and trust their intuition. Active listening is specially important in effective front leadership. A front leader, opens the door, not only listen but encourage new ideas, acknowledge them, then makes the best decision with the information they have. They also gives credit to those participated. If a leader fails to do so, then he/she will be perceived as malicious and will loose trust and help of creative people.

### Sitting on the sideline

<div class="container">

  </div>
  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Successful leaders know how to and must delegate, sideline leadership happens when they fail to do so. Leaders who "lead" from side, fail to trust their followers. It's easier for them to do the job rather than empower and trust others to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my experience, ego is high in this style and those who are new to leadership must watch out not to fall into this category specially if they didn't have enough training or intuition. It takes time and practice to let go! You can detect this style of leadership when you see a leader, for example, works extra hours to make sure things are "perfect" while he/she is on a break, if they take any! They tend to be nervous about leaving and often they are right, because, work will get piled up. The second the leader is back they have to work much harder to pick up the pile off the floor,
      because the followers didn't know what to do while their leader was gone. Team is hurting from lack of communication or understanding of the vision. The Leaders are often burn out and tired. They consider themselves as bullet proof, things well get done even if they have to be up all night every night. A side-leader often blames things on the incompetency of the team rather than look deep to find the root cause of the problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style is leadership is very dangerous and ineffective. The team will feel disconnected. Even if the project succeeds the won't feel the win. Followers may have low job satisfaction because they may feel they didn't do their job. The other risk is the leader holds most of the knowledge and therefore will be hard for the employer to fire him or her. When the leader decides to leave the company, however, the project or the company will feel the pain.

### Leading from behind

    <blockquote>
      ....
      <br />
      Instead of writing them a "manual," as he'd originally planned, he sent an email that said, simply, "Don't ask me
      for permission. Do what you think is right." The unbearable stream of emails from the reps to Ferriss dried up
      overnight; meanwhile, customer service at the company improved dramatically. "It's amazing," he says,
      "how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them."
      And, as far too many can attest, how it halves when you take that responsibility and trust away.
      <br />

    <p>
      Leading from behind is hard and a bit confusing for many people. It requires trust, flexibility, and some tolerance for failure. Leaders who lead from back, might be mistaken with those who are not engaging or not doing the work. When utilized properly, leading from behind is very empowering. Leaders are expected to provide a safety net for their followers to be creative and allow them to explore, do mistakes (in a safe environment) and grow.
      They are, however, always available to consult or take charge when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style of leadership has become my favorite when circumstances are right. It is great for organizations who are big on creativity and pride themselves in growing future leaders. This style also shifts the micromanagement to followers holding themselves to high standards, because they are given authority, trust, and means to do the job "right".
    </p>
    <p>
      When leader observers followers from back, he or she also gets to see individual's strengths and weaknesses and can help them improve or assigning them tasks that best fits their strengths. The leader then has time to building a successful and strong team which is self-organizing and can operate when they are left alone instead of micromanaging everything that has to be done in the way they have envisioned. The goal is to build a team that
      can innovate!
    </p>
    <p>
      One important key here is, leading from behind doesn't mean to leave people to whatever they want! Freedom is not absolute. Followers must have a clear vision of the goals and timeline. The expected result is known, the means to get there can be let up to the followers.
    </p>

### Visionary Leadership

<div class="container">
  <div class="left image">

  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      Visionary leadership is crucial in having a successful organization. A visionary leader is an innovator and is hard to replace. It's important for the visionary leader to document their principles so that their successors can follow. In an event that the visionary successful steps down or in Steve Job passes away, the successor and the followers need to refer to the principals to help the organization survive. Otherwise, the organization will go
      through a difficult time, if they ever manage to survive. Therefore, one of the skills of a visionary leader is great communication!
    </p>
    <p>
      Visionary leaders are not only creative and are able to be very direct and clear about their vision and thoughts but they are also great listeners. They understand that even though they are in a position to make the final decision, they may not always have the best or the most accurate idea. They actively listen to those around them and welcome, in fact encourage, their opinion with an open mind.
    </p>

### Micromanagers

<div class="container">

  <div class="right text">
    <p>
      And... there always those who just CANNOT LET GO, the Micromanagers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Micromanagers not only have a hard time letting go but they actively resist delegation. They often become a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step. They get involved in other’s work without consulting them and provide too many direction. They do not setup or tolerate failure, they want to "force people to enter heavens!" Micromanagers, looking at every single details of how a job gets done instead of the overall picture. They require constant detail reporting and attend every meeting to ensure no decision is made without their input. They push aside the experience and knowledge of colleagues and are often lead a demotivated team. Those who are highly skilled and creative will get pushed away and eventually leave the the team.
      <br />
      This by far is my least style of <b>management</b>. In fact, I don't consider micromanagers leader or managers, they are the bottleneck!
