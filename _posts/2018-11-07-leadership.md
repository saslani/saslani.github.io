Why am I writing this article?

Warning: this article is not for those who believe in Young Earth creationism, dinosaur bones are real!

- There has been a lot of talk about leadership around me..
- Observed great leadership that the leader enables employees to do what's right to do, and steps in only if help is needed
- Observed questionable leadership that's more "boss like"
- Why am I interested in this topic
- Our parents were committed to 1 company, if our generation sticks around for more than 2-3 years we celebrate. Loyalty is chaning
- The contract between companies and employees are changing.

  <title>Organization History</title>

  <div class="container">
    Before we jump into why we need organization and leadership let’s take a quick walk into where we came from and why our
    genus Homo Sapiens succeed.
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      The sapiens thought to have merged around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Roughly around 200,000 years ago Homo sapiens
      became recognizable. They evolved in Africa and migrated somewhere around 90,000 years ago. Homo sapiens developed
      capacity for language only around 50,000 years ago. Our ancestors migrated from Africa to Successfuly populate the
      world, including to Europe where Neanderthals has already been settled.

      <p>
        There are several hypothesis as why sapiens succeeded but not neanderthals even though neanderthals were physically
        stronger and faster in short distance run. Some of those hypothesis include: violence from modern human, diseases,
        competitive exclusion, inbreeding, climate change or a combination of these and more...
      </p>
      <p>
        One hypothesis that relates to this article is <b>the brain power</b>.
        <br />
        Neanderthals had brawn but humans advantage on brains. Sapiens brain were built to support more complex functions
        such as creativity, communication and imagination. In short, one explanation is that imaginations, ability to believe
        myth and fictions, and ability to mass communicate (storytelling) became our ancestors biggest advantage.

      Another example of human’s creative mind is religion. We are capable of believing in supernatural. Our creative mind
      allows us to believe in extraordinary things like God with unlimited power and so kind who is also tolerant of all the
      suffering in the world. We have communicated those belief and created a community around it. Hence, one of human’s
      biggest invention is region!

  <title>socialization</title>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Human are also social animals. But what is socialization and are they limits to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking too much in biology, let's look back, once again, evolution supports socialization (sorry introverts,
      including myself!). If father and mother stayed around longer, children had a better chance of surviving. Larger
      families and tribes could also better defend themselves against intruders.

        If one has to only answer to themselves and can do whatever they want, can we call it a team or an organization?
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when we add a second person to the team? Now we have links n*(n-1)/2
        The moment we add a second person, we have a team dynamics, it’s a small team but it is at last a team
      </p>
      <p>
        Now come a few hundred thousands forward, what team size is right?

        In the following context, let's define relationship as knowing well who each person is and how are they related to
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though human are social, there’s limit to our social skills which we can have a meaningful, stable and cohesive
        relationship with others.
        The real number falls somewhere between 100 to 250, commonly <b>150</b>.
        <br />
        The formula above was first proposed in 1990 by an anthropologist name Robin Dunbar as the Primate brain size and
        average of social group size.

        Durban suggests that a number larger than this requires restrictions, laws and enforced norms to maintain a
        <b>stable</b> and <b>cohesive</b> group. In other words, our brain struggles to make meaningful and stable
        relationships when the number is greater than Durbin’s number. That’s why we cannot trust strangers and that’s why
        we form tribes, organization and governments.
      </p>

        Now, we are entering the Complex Adaptive System subject. Which is a system in which a perfect understanding of the
        individual parts does not automatically convey a perfect understanding of the whole system's behavior.

  <title>Organization Structure</title>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Before we start talking about leadership styles and their effectiveness let's take a look at different organizations
        throughout the history. Considering evolution, we see that we have evolved from small groups of family to survive to
        build today’s mega city and civilization. We went from staying together in group of dozens to have our species
        survive and pass our genes. To understanding biology and manipulating our genes! But, we couldn't have came so far
        if we had stayed in our small family circle or tribes. Forming bigger groups and organizations allowed us to shift
        our attention from just survival to understanding the world around us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book “reinventing organization” groups the organizations’ involvement as the following:

        Organizations don't exist at this stage, yet. However, tribes of few hundred started forming.
        Elders had special status (walking libraries) because of their experience and knowledge.
        Humanity shifted to stage of consciousness. This was a magical time because human started believing in magics.
        However, Cause and effect are poorly understood. Some describe this ara as when our sensorimotor started developing.

      Some time around 10,000 years ago leaders started ruling by force and fear. The group size was well above
      Dunbar’s number. The tribes realized that they have to use control to defend ourselves.
      Ego started to form, individuals had a sense of self that separates them from others. Tribes were subsisting
      on horticulture which was the start of civilization, and eventually institutions.

        Within the past couple of centuries, humankind have evolved far beyond absolute right or wrong. We started
        to understand and handle greater complexity. This was the start of industrial revolution. We understood machines and
        as a result, started making our organizations like machines. If you look closely at most leaders in business and
        politics worldwide, you see they are operating in achievement orange organizations. Other examples of this group are
        corporations such as Walmart and Coca-Cola.
      </p>
      <p>
        Achievement orange organizations' effectiveness is through
        <b>innovation</b>, <b>accountability</b>, and <b>meritocracy</b>.
        <br />
        This is the time that organizations started having research and development, marketing,
        and product management departments.
        The traditional <b>Command and Control</b> is now shifted to <b>Predict and Control</b>. Managers set achievement
        target for their employees and those who reach their target are getting rewarded by being promoted
        or getting a salary raise or bonus.

      <p>
        Pluralistic green organizations are still relatively new, they started forming in the current century while
        orange is still dominant in politics and businesses. The break though here is <b>empowerment</b>! The organizations
        still operate in pyramid hierarchy but managers push through majority voting and are expected to share power.
        Examples of green organizations are academic thinking, nonprofits, social workers, and community activists.
        Some organizations who are also early adopters of pluralistic green are Southwest Airlines, and Ben and Jerry's.
        <br />
        Another noticeable change in pluralistic green organizations is that management style has shifted from
        being a boss to modest behavior. This modesty is a result of understanding and respecting other people's feelings.
        Not only manager are expected to be respectful and open minded, green organizations also invest in
        soft-skill trainings for their employees.
        <br />
        Green organizations practice 360-degree reviews, meaning not only managers review their employees, employees also
        get to review their managers and provide feedback and improvements.
        <br />
        Culture is very important, for example Southwest believes in Freedom, and Ben and Jerry's pride themselves for
        caring about Environment.
        <br />
        The downside of green organizations is that even though they pride themselves as being open minded and tolerant.
        They are also intolerant of those who don't fit their "culture!"

        There is an evolution in consciousness, that there is a momentum in evolution towards ever more complex and
        refined ways of dealing with the world. In this stage, we are now well aware of complexity.
        Instead of either-or there is both-and. We must combine and process information in a new way that disidentify

        smarter groups are essential. These group focuses on increasing in emotional intelligence and therefore increasing

        So far, we looked into the history of groups and organizations. We understood why we're social and why forming teams
        was essential to our survival. Also, as Dunbar suggests as our teams and organizations got bigger the need for leaders
        grow. Not only just a leader, but also the leadership style. In a modern society a company who wants to run their
        organization like an impulsive red is not going to survive. Meanwhile, military cannot operate in pluralistic green or
        evolutionary teal, especially during war!
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for us to determine what type of organization we have or want, and how our leaders should operate, let's
        take a loop at some leadership styles. We have to decide what organization we want before we have a shanty town.
        Who sets the goal and the vision and what are we here to achieve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Across all these styles, a strong leader not only is setting a long term vision on how life is going to be
        in 5, 10, 20 years from now, but makes sure that the employees are well-aware of the goals and empowers them to
        get there. Setting goals is an expectation for leaders but it's equally important to understand how do a
        leader handle disagreement and intolerance. Is the plan to prison the person who made a mistake or cast them out?
        If everyone is agreeable then leadership is easy. What what if there’s diversity? What’s someone’s perspective
        of someone else’s viewpoint? What happens to diversity of values?

      Organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership.
      Leadership is the ability to set visions and influence followers, providing support and guidance, to achieve a goal.
      In some organizations, Leaders are also managers.

      But Leaders and Management need different set of skills even though the names are often used interchangeably.
      The key difference here is not evert manger is necessarily a strong leader! Eevn though the two have
      some responsibilities and expectations in common, leader is the visionary who focuses on the long term goal and
      should not be bothered by smaller tasks. Leader's job is to sell that vision to clients, employees and managers.
      Managers, on the other hand, have more freedom when it comes to communicating that vision to employees and assign
      tasks to help the employees and the company reach its goal.

        Before we dive deeper in leadership styles, it's important to understand <b>What leadership is not?</b><br />
        Simply, if no one is following, you are not leading (you might think you are leading, but you are not)!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's look at some leadership styles

      Leading from front
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        In this style of leadership, leaders are steps ahead than their followers to make sure the task is doable
        before they ask others do them. You can detect this style in organizations when you see the leaders who are
        fully engaged and their also need to approve before any one takes a different approach to problem solving.
        <br />
        This style of leadership is inspired by military. Orders are given, everyone agrees and follows the leader.
        Even though leading from front is well-suited for military or in time or crises, it's very limiting in
        organizations who are priding themselves in creativity. Leading from front, doesn't leave much room for
        creativity as followers are often told what to do.

      <blockquote>
        ....<br />
        Instead of writing them a "manual," as he'd originally planned, he sent an email that said, simply,
        "Don't ask me for permission. Do what you think is right." The unbearable stream of emails from the reps
        to Ferriss dried up overnight; meanwhile, customer service at the company improved dramatically.
        "It's amazing," he says, "how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and
        indicate that you trust them." And, as far too many can attest, how it halves when you take that responsibility
        and trust away. <br />

      Sitting on the sideline
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Successful managers know how to and must delegate, sideline leadership happens when they fail to do so.
      Leaders who "lead" from side, fail to trust their followers. It's easier for them to do the job rather than
      empower and trust others to do it.
      <br />
      From my experience, ego is high in this style and those who are new to leadership often fall in danger of falling
      into this category if they didn't have enough training or intuition. It takes time and practice to let go! You can
      detect this style of leadership when you see a leader, for example, works extra hours to make sure things are "ok"
      while he/she is on a break, if they take any! They tend to be nervous about leaving and often they are right, because,
      work will get piled up. The second the leader is back they have to work much harder to pike up the pile off the floor,
      because the followers didn't know what to do while their leader was gone. Team is hurting from lack of communication
      or understanding of the vision.
      <br />
      The Leaders are often burn out and tired, because they consider themselves as bullet proof.

      Leading from behind
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Leading from behind is hard and a bit confusing for many people. It requires trust, flexibility, and some tolerance
      for failure. Leaders who lead from back, might be mistaken with those who are not engaging or not doing the work.
      When utilized properly, leading from behind is very empowering. Leaders are expected to provide a safety net for
      their followers to be creative and allow them to explore, do mistakes (in a safe environment) and grow.
      They are, however, always available to consult or take charge when needed.
      <br />
      This style of leadership is great for organizations who are big on creativity and pride themselves in growing
      future leaders. This also shifts the micromanagement style to followers holding themselves to high standards,
      because they are given authority, trust, and means to do the job.
      <br />
      When leader observer followers from back, he or she also gets to see individual's strengths and weaknesses and can
      help them improve or assigning them tasks that best fits their strengths. The leader then has time to building a
      Successful and strong team which is self-organizing and can operate when they are left alone instead of
      micromanaging everything that has to be done in the way they have envisioned. The goal is to build a team that
      can innovate!
      <br />
      One important key here is, leading from behind doesn't mean to leave people to whatever they want! Freedom is not
      absolute. Followers must have a clear vision of the goals and timeline. The expected result is known, the means
      to get there can be let up to the followers.

      Visionary Leadership
    </div>
    <div class="left text">
      Visionary leadership is crucial in having a Successful organization. A visionary leader is hard to replace.
      It's important for the visionary leader to document their principals who that their succeeders can leave up to
      explanations and are able to learn and improve what made the organization Successful at some time. Otherwise, the
      organization will go through a difficult time, if they ever manage to survive. Therefore, one of the skills
      of a visionary leader is great communication!
      <br />
      These leaders are not only creative and are able to be very direct and clear about their vision and thoughts
      but they are also great listeners. They understand that even though they are in a position to make the final
      decision, they may not always have the best or the most accurate idea. They actively listen to those around them
      and welcome, in fact encourage, their opinion with an open mind.

      That there always those who just CANNOT LET GO, the Micromanagers!
      <br />
      Micromanagers not only have a hard time letting go but they actively resist delegation. They are often the becoming
      a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step. They get involved in other’s work without consulting
      them and provide too many direction. They do not setup or tolerate failure, they want to "force people to enter heavens!"
      Micromanagers, looking at the details of how a job gets done instead of the overall picture. They require constant
      detail reporting and attend every meetings to ensure no decision is made without their input. They push aside the
      experience and knowledge of colleagues and are often lead a demotivated team. Those who are highly skilled and creative
      will get pushed away and eventually leave the the team.

      As we talked about different organizations and leadership styles, it's important to point out some technics that helps leaders categorize their problems and how they are going to respond.
      David Snowden created a "sencemaking device", aka. Cynefin model, in 1999, while he was working at IBM Global Services.
      <br />
      Cynefin, which means habitat in Welsh, describes five decision making domains: Obvious (Simple), Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Disorder. Leaders can use this model to make sense of their situation,
      either project or people behaviour related.  Here is a breakdown each each domain:
      <div class="subsection_title">
        Obvious / Simple:
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        The obvious state is the <b>Know Kowns</b> state. Meaning that the rules are in place, cause and effects are knows and situation is stable.
      </div>

      <div class="subsection_title">
        Complicated
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        Known unknows

      <div class="subsection_title">

      <div class="text">
        Unknown unknows

      <div class="subsection_title">
        Chaotic

      Clockwise
      Counter clockwise

      Cynefin = Habitat, haunt, acquainted, familiar

      Weather we are a leader at a company, in the group of friends or home, all of can benefit from practicing leadership skills and know when we need to change our style.
