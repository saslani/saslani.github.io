Warning: this article is not for those who believe in Young Earth creationism, dinosaur bones are real!

- There has been a lot of talk about leadership around me..
- Observed great leadership that the leader enables employees to do what's right to do, and steps in only if help is needed
- Observed questionable leadership that's more "boss like"
- Why am I interested in this topic

  <title>Organization History</title>

  <div class="container">
    Before we jump into why we need organization and leadership let’s take a quick walk into where we came from and why our genus Homo Sapiens succeed.
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      The sapiens thought to have merged around 300,000 to 200,000 years ago. Roughly around 200,000 years ago Homo sapiens became recognizable.
      They evolved in Africa and migrated somewhere around 90,000 years ago. Homo sapiens developed capacity for language only around 50,000 years ago.
      Our ancestors migrated from Africa to successfully populate the world, including to Europe where Neanderthals has already been settled.

    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        There are several hypothesis as why sapiens succeeded but not neanderthals even though neanderthals were physically stronger and faster
        in short distance run. Some of those hypothesis include: violence from modern human, deseases, competitive exclusion, inbreading,
        climate change or a combination of these and more...
      </p>
      <p>
        One hypothesis that relates to this article is <b>the brain power</b>.
        <br />
        Neanderthals had brawn but humans advantage on brains. Sapiens brain were build to support more complex functions such as creativity,
        communication and imagination. In short, one explanation is that imaginations, ability to believe myth and fictions, and ability to
        mass communicate (storytelling) became our ancestors biggest advantage.
      </p>

        And the lord stood upon Tiamat’s hinder parts,<br />
        And with his merciless club he smashed her skull.<br />
        He cut through the channels of her blood,<br />
        And he made the North wind bear it away into secret places.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example of human’s creative mind is religion. We are capable of believing in supernatural. Our creative mind allows us to
        believe in extraordinary things like God with unlimited power and so kind who is also tolerant of all the suffering in the world.
        We have communicated those belief and created a community around it. Hence, one of human’s biggest invention is region!

  <title>socialization</title>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Human are also social animals. But what is socialization and are they limits to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking too much in biology, let's look back, once again, evolution supports socialization (sorry introverts, including myself!).
      If father and mother stayed around longer, children had a better chance of surviving. Larger families and tribes could also better defend
      themselves against intruders.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        If one has to only answer to themselves and can do whatever they want, can we call it a team or an organization?
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when we add a second person to the team? Now we have links n*(n-1)/2
        The moment we add a second person, we have a team dynamics, it’s a small team but it is at last a team
      </p>
      <p>
        Now come a few hundred thousands forward, what team size is right?
        <br />
        <blockquote>

        In the following context, let's define relationship as knowing well who each person is and how are they related to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though human are social, there’s limit to our social skills which we can have a meaningful, stable and cohesive relationship with others.
        The real number falls somewhere between 100 to 250, commonly <b>150</b>.
        <br />
        The formula above was first proposed in 1990 by an anthropologist name Robin Dunbar as the Pirmate brain size and average of social group size.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="left text">
      <p>
        Durban suggests that a number larger than this requires restrictions, laws and enforced norms to maintain a <b>stable</b> and <b>cohesive</b> group.
        In other words, our brain struggles to make meaningful and stable relationships when the number is grater than Durbin’s number.
        That’s why we cannot trust strangers and that’s why we form tribes, organization and governments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we are entering the Complex Adaptive System subject. Which is a system in which a perfect understanding of the individual parts does not automatically convey a perfect understanding of the whole system's behavior.

  <title>Organization Structure</title>

  <div class="container">

      <p>
        By looking at history and evolution, we see that we have evolved from small groups of family to survive to build today’s mega city and civilization. 
        We went form staying together in group of dozens to have our species survive and pass our genes. To understanding biology and manipulating our genes! But, we couldn't have came so far if we had stayed in our small family circle or tribes. Forming bigger groups and organizations allowed us to shift our attention from just survival to understanding the world around us.

      We have to decide what organization we want before we have a shanty town
      Who set’s the goal and the vision and what are we here to achieve
      Across all these style leader is setting a long term vision on how life is going to be in 5, 10, 20 years from now
      Do you, as employee, want to leave there?
      What does the leader do? How do you handle disagreement and intolerance? is the plan prison the person? cast them out?
      If everyone is agreeable then leadership is easy. What what if there’s diversity? what’s someone’s prospective as someone else’s view point? what about diversity of values

  <title>Leadership</title>

      organization, as we know today cannot succeed without strong leadership.
      Leadership is the ability to set visions and influence followers, providing support and guidance, to achieve a goal.
      In some organizations, Leaders are also managers.

      But Leaders and Management need different set of skills even though the names are often used interchangeably.

      They both:
      Accomplish a goal
      Mobilize resources
      Explain vision

      Leaders:
      Set visions and foster ideas
      Focus on Goals
      Sell it
      Take risks
      Break the rules

      Managers:
      Focus on tasks
      Tell it
      Go with the flow
      Approve
      Follow rules
      Assign tasks

      Micromanagement signs:
      Resist delegation
      Being a bottleneck and demand approval and communication in every step
      Get involved in other’s work without consulting them
      Give too many direction
      Don’t setup or tolerate failure (Force people to heavens!)
      Looking at details instead of the overall picture
      Push aside the experience and knowledge of colleagues
      Demotivated team

      There are many types of leadership and each could be suitable in different scenarios. For example in military during war type, there should be no democracy or leading from behind otherwise the consequences are irreversible.
      But in our day-to-day life, personal or professional most of the time we can benefit more from trust and experiment. Some of us might have experienced micromanagement at some point or other.
