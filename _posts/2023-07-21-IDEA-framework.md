Sharing some thoughts on fostering a culture of continuous experimentation in my latest piece on InfoQ.

# Key Takeaways

* Establish new agility practices that are compatible with values defined in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. These practices are essential for creating functional, efficient, and adaptive teams.
* Adopt the “Nail It, Then Scale It” philosophy to allow teams to refine a product with smaller scope before moving on to larger, more complex challenges.
* Foster a collaborative and inclusive team environment with frequent, candid communication.
* Conduct pre-mortems to anticipate and prepare for potential problems, reducing the number of post-mortems. This ultimately saves time and prepares the team to handle problems if they arise.
* Establish a robust feedback loop to enable the teams to continuously learn, adapt, and improve, which is the cornerstone of agile methodology.
